2/6/2024
First Meeting with TA
Outcome:
	We would probably have to create out own radio driver circuit
	IF a board exists that does something we dont need to make it
	Overall our project sounds good
2/7/2024
Objective: first main meeting, go over plans
Notes:
	2 boards, 1 on headset one on drone
	One on drone takes lightwight camera signal (https://www.amazon.com/Readytosky-Camera-1000TVL-Switchable-Quadcopter/dp/B07C9MVV9B/ref=asc_df_B07C9MVV9B/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693389209895&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16690768769151422481&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022185&hvtargid=pla-979917058773&psc=1&mcid=5979a648d3663477939c685e634154d6&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pV_Tgy0uwV9IERtCiZiNghxpjWnhBA-NHhJVOx8xVne1ikjiVmtXjxoCd2wQAvD_BwE)
	Translates to signal to be transmitted by radio driver
	Headset board takes radio signal and creates HDMI output for headset
	HEadset board also drives LEDs
2/9/2024
Objective: Meeting with John Hart
Notes
	Vicon tracks infrared
	Programmable light array
	Track in drone arena
	Main project: make FPV drone
	Lightweight Crazyflie drone
	small camera
	FPV headset
2/13/2024
Second Meeting with TA
NotesL
	Idea sounds good
	Might not actually have to make radio driver from scratch like we thought
	Might be better idea to use ESP32s
2/17/2024
Objective: Figure out ESP32 wifi and what are plans are
Notes:
	This chip looks good (https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_esp32-wroom-32ue_datasheet_en.pdf)
	Can transmit at 11 Mbps, should be enough for basic video streaming
	This camera looks better (https://www.amazon.com/Caddx-Camera-1200TVL-Global-Aspect/dp/B088TDTL1M/ref=asc_df_B088TDTL1M/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693507718463&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15516276528404537276&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022185&hvtargid=pla-1623817107085&psc=1&mcid=e3031e7e40163cdfaa157d280ec9d6cd&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pRzYenXu-OBiFW5bV-7LvnH69FqI0qNBb9d_v_zgfCuDr1PEd9CzSRoCC64QAvD_BwE)
	Smaller, lighter, and uses NTSC
	ESP32 too slow for HDMI, we should use composite video
2/18/2024
Meet to work on design document
	Found correct LEDs that are at correct frequency for vicon
2/19/2024
Meet to work on design document
	Wrote power system requirements
2/20/2024
Meet to work on design document
	Crazyflie battery: 350mAh at 3.7V,  5.25A.
	consumes 100mA while stationary and 7W when flying unburdened at 27 grams(https://forum.bitcraze.io/viewtopic.php?t=711#:~:text=Re%3A%20Crazyflie%20current%20draw&text=When%20the%20Crazyflie%20hovers%20it,during%20bursts%20up%20to%204A.)
	camera weighs 2.5 grams, add 10g for everything else
	7W/(27g)^2=.0096
	27g+2.5g+10g=39.5g
	15W/3.7V=4.05A

	Camera uses 120ma
	other boards 200ma
	4.57A
	1260As in battery means battery life of 275 seconds
2/29/2024
Prupose: Post design review meeting
Notes:
	Move forward with PCB design
	Ill take LED board
	Hunter Takes Drone board
	Eli takes Headset
	Drone board literally just has to drive 4 leds to have one at a time illuminated via switch
	Just need flip flops or something
3/4/2024
Missed PCB deadline
We'll order after spring break
I think im good though, I just need to JK flip flops and a demultiplexer
	Something simple like this https://www.ti.com/product/SN54HC109-SP
3/20/2024
Goals: Post spring break get back in groove
We need to finish designing the boards
Start testing stuff on the proper dev boards when we order them
We know which ones to order now
3/26/2024
Goals: Design Meeting
Notes:
	Changing from ESP 32 on custom board to esp32-cam
	Something like this (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/)
	Properly have LED board all planned out. Two JK flip flops into each other into a demux
	Eli seems good with the headset board but has to do some redesigning
4/1/2024
Goals: PCB overview
Notes:
	Changed ground from normal wires connected to a ground pin to a masking layer connected to the ground pin
	Allows for beter grounding
	All boards ready to order
4/5/2024
Goals: Figure out dev boards
Notes:
	Figured out ESP32-cam board with arguino
	Know how to program board now
	(Followed this tutorial successfully https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-web-server-camera-home-assistant/)
4/8/2024
Goals: Meeting to figure out New PCBs
Notes:
	Eli had to redesign board due to wrong ESP-32 without DACs
	THat prevents us from using composite video
	We could use HDMI instead but we'd have to redesign the board anyway
	May as well stick to original plan with new chip with DACs
	I made the buttons incorrectly on the LED board, figured that out by breadboarding it
	Just simplifying button design
	Also make new board with switches instead
	Remove JK flip flops
	Now lighter and more consistent, no need to debounce
	Button was easier to use
	Can just use switches from lab kit
4/10/2024
Goals: admin meeting
Notes:
	Seem to be on track, a bit behind on PCB ordering
	To ensure we get it on time we should order from third party as well for faster shipping
	Spend rest of week writing code so out boards are ready when we need them
4/13/2024
Goals: coding dev boards
Notes:
	We should use UDP instead of TCP
	UDP is faster but drops more packets
	Better for streaming video
	some of teh frames might be wrong but latency is lower

	Wrote simple testing code for ESP32 cam
	At top sets up cam
	In setup() {
	Initializes camera from library
	Begins serial
	Begins wifi
	Opens UDP port
	Print IP address
	}

	In loop() {
	run camera
	get packet size
	Check connection with headset board
	Read UDP packet
	Print size of image for debugging
	Prepare buffer in memory
	get frame buffer from camera
	load camera frame buffer into UDP buffer
	print cam buffer (This can be compared to the .jpeg magic bits to ensure its getting the file correctly from the camera)
	Print buffer to the UDP connection
	}

	And then the headset board just prints everything it receives via UDP
	And we can do the same trick with the .jpeg magic bytes (FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01)
4/17/2024
Goals: solder the PCBs that arrived
Notes:
	Green LEDs lit up when the switches were flipped
	We ended up frying the IC on the board with loose wires (Connectors hadn't been soldered on yet)
	Otherwise board seems to work
	We seem prepared for the demo, the other boards work and will run the test code we wrote for the dev boards
4/20/2024
Goals: finalize everything for the demo
Notes:
	Drone doesn't fly
	Camera runs but not well, we have to solder some jumper wires in place
	JPEG to CSV wont work, we will just stream to the laptop
	LEDs can be seen on a camera and filmed
	Vicon follows drone
4/21/2024
Goals: Prepare for demo
Notes:
	Got drone to run with camera attached
	Still no JPEG conversion code
	CAn just use webserver on laptop and HDMI cable to share screen to get video onto headset
4/24/2024
Goals: Prepare Presentation
Notes:
	Not much tbh
4/28/2024
Goals: Prepare for final demonstration
Notes:
	Did all the verification for our parts
	Made graphs etc
	OUR DRONE FLIES!!!!!!!
	Turns out our motors only got to 80%, can be boosted in software
	Too late for light lab
	We can do all the filming and testing tomorrow morning before presentation at 3:00
4/29/2024
Goals: include flight stuff
Notes:
	Filmed flight
	Broke a camera (on redesign they shouldn't be attached entirely via ribbon cable lmao)
	Changed presentation to include references to how we can flight
	Changed successes, failures, and future optimizations to reflect we can now fly
