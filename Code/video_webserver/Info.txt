This program posts the camera feed to a webserver
(196.168.4.1 in my experience but i honestly dont know how to find this without trial and error)

In order to edit this to post video read from the ESP32-CAM, remove all refrences to the camera
- include OV2640
- cam.___() calls in handle_jpg_stream
- cam.init() call in setup

Then, edit the client.write() call in handle_jpg_stream to push the new video feed to the server

Also, the current implementation acts as a softAP, make sure the ESP32-CAM is not hosting wifi
