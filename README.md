# FPV Drone Project - ECE 445

This repository contains the design and implementation files for the FPV (First-Person View) Drone project developed by Hunter, Eli, and Griffin for the ECE 445 final project at the University of Illinois.

## Project Overview

The FPV Drone project aims to create a robust and user-friendly drone capable of transmitting real-time video to the user, providing an immersive flying experience. This project covers both the hardware design including the drone's frame, motors, and camera setup, and the software development for flight control and video transmission.

## Installation

See the [installation instructions](install.md) for detailed setup.

### Setting up the development environment

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine, version 3.9.6 or higher.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/H-Bombmxpwr/FPV_Drone.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd FPV_Drone
   ```

4. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
   On macOS and Linux:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

6. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
