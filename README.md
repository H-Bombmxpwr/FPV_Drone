# FPV Drone Project - ECE 445

This repository contains the design and implementation files for the FPV (First-Person View) Drone project developed by Hunter, Eli, and Griffin for the ECE 445 final project at the University of Illinois.

## Project Overview

The FPV Drone project aims to create a robust and user-friendly drone capable of transmitting real-time video to the user, providing an immersive flying experience. This repository includes everything that was used in one way or another to make this project. 

## Directories

- Code
   - Low level arduino and c code for programming 
- crazyflie_control
   - Software to control the Crazyflie Drone
   - Firmware to flash the Crazyflie Done
   - Extensive debugging tools for setup
- Documents
   - Power Points
   - Design Documents
   - PCB Design Documents
   - Images
   - Personal notes
   - Needed Documentation

## Getting Started
If you are looking to control the drone with your computer you will need:
- Crazyflie 2.0 Drone
- Crazyradio or Crazyflie PA
- Gaming Controller Controller

Then follow the list of steps in [install.md](install.md).
